# Acoustic Echo Removal using Residual U-Net

## Introduction

This article introduces an interesting approach to address the challenge of
acoustic echo cancellation using a U-Net convolutional neural network. The
U-Net architecture was initially developed for medical image segmentation tasks,
allowing precise identification and analysis of different regions within images. It
proved to be highly effective in the medical domain.
However, this article recognized the potential of the U-Net architecture beyond
medical imaging by training the U-Net model to estimate and separate the
residual echo component from the original audio signal mixed with echoes to
improve the performance of the acoustic echo canceler.

## Residual Echo

Residual echo is a persistent sound that lingers in an audio signal even after the
original sound has been transmitted or produced. You may have experienced it
during audio conferencing or virtual meetings when you hear your own voice or
the voices of others echoing back with a slight delay. This echo effect occurs due
to reflections and delays in the audio transmission path.

In audio conferencing, residual echo can cause several problems. It can be
distracting and disrupt the flow of conversation, making it difficult to concentrate
and understand what others are saying. The overlapping sounds can reduce the
clarity of speech, making it harder to discern words and phrases. In some cases,
the echo can even become amplified and result in screeching or howling
feedback loops that render communication impossible.

That's why it's important to remove or minimize residual echo in audio
conferencing systems. By doing so, we can ensure clear and natural-sounding
communication. Removing echo improves overall communication by enabling
participants to understand each other better and engage in effective
conversations. It enhances the user experience, allowing us to focus on the
content being discussed rather than being distracted by disruptive echoes. Clear
audio without echo is particularly important in professional settings, as it helps
maintain professionalism and credibility during business meetings, conferences,
or remote collaboration.

To remove residual echo, audio conferencing systems use techniques like
acoustic echo cancellation (AEC). AEC algorithms analyze the incoming audio
signal, identify the echo component, and subtract it from the received signal
before it is played back to participants. These algorithms continuously adapt to
changes in the acoustic environment, providing effective echo suppression and
ensuring clear audio quality

## Dataset

To train the U-Net model for acoustic echo cancellation, we have utilized an
open-sourced dataset provided by Microsoft for the Acoustic Echo Cancellation
Challenge. This challenge aimed to advance the development of AEC models
and foster innovation in the field. Microsoft generously made available two
extensive datasets for training AEC models, encompassing both single talk and
double talk scenarios.

These datasets were meticulously compiled and comprised recordings from over
10,000 real audio devices and human speakers in real-world environments. By
incorporating such a large and diverse collection of audio samples, the dataset
captured the intricacies and variations encountered in practical AEC scenarios.
Additionally, the dataset also included a synthetic dataset, expanding the range
of training data available for the U-Net model.

## Model Architecture

The model takes an input of shape (160, 32, 2), representing the audio
spectrogram with two channels. The first channel as nearend microphone signal,
while the second channel as far-end speech.

Encoder

The U-Net model starts with a series of convolutional layers in the encoder
section. The input is passed through several layers, each consisting of a 3x3
convolution operation, followed by batch normalization, ReLU activation, and
dropout for regularization. The number of filters gradually increases to capture
hierarchical features. After each convolutional layer, max-pooling is applied to
downsample the feature maps.

Decoder

The decoder section of the U-Net model aims to reconstruct the estimated
echo-free audio signal from the encoded features. It employs transpose
convolutions (also known as deconvolutions) to upsample the feature maps. The
upsampled features are then combined with the corresponding features from the
encoder path using skip connections, allowing the model to access both low-level
and high-level features. Similar to the encoder, the decoder also includes
convolutional layers with batch normalization, ReLU activation, and dropout

Output

The final layer of the U-Net model consists of a 1x1 convolutional layer with a
linear activation function. It outputs a single-channel spectrogram representing
the estimated echo-free audio signal.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this article presents an innovative approach to address acoustic
echo cancellation using the U-Net model. By leveraging the U-Net architecture
and training it to estimate and separate the residual echo component from the
original audio signal, improvements in the performance of the acoustic echo
canceler can be achieved. The article also highlights the importance of removing
residual echo in audio conferencing systems to ensure clear and effective
